Causes include limitations in Natural Language Understanding (NLU), inability to maintain context, or flaws in conversational design. It negatively impacts user experience by leading to inefficiency, diminishing trust, and reducing satisfaction."}, {"name": "Causes of Conversational Drift", "details": [{"cause": "Ambiguity in User Input", "description": "User language is unclear or has multiple meanings, making it difficult for the LLM to determine the correct conversation path. Example: 'I'd like to make a reservation for this weekend' (ambiguity: hotel, restaurant, car)."}, {"cause": "Inadequate Context Management", "description": "Long or complex dialogues challenge the LLM’s ability to track conversation history, leading to responses misaligned with the current topic. Example: Chatbot fails to recall prior discussion about budget concerns for 'Thompson project' and responds as if initiating budget planning."}, {"cause": "Overgeneralization", "description": "LLMs may provide generic responses disconnected from specific nuances. Example: User asks for kid-friendly restaurant, chatbot responds with general statement about healthy eating."}, {"cause": "Limited Domain Knowledge", "description": "LLMs may lack proficiency in specialized topics, causing a loss of focus in technical discussions. Example: User asks for specific CRISPR research, chatbot gives general comment on gene editing."}]}, {"name": "Prevention Techniques for Conversational Drift", "details": [{"technique": "Enhanced Contextual Understanding", "description": "Improve the chatbot’s ability to understand and remember conversation context.
