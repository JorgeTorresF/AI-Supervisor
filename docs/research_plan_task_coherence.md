# Research Plan: Task Coherence and Context Drift in AI Agents

## Research Objectives
Analyze task coherence and context drift problems in AI agents, focusing on:
1. Common causes of task switching and context drift
2. How contextual keywords trigger unwanted behavior changes
3. Techniques for maintaining conversation focus
4. Intent preservation and context anchoring methods
5. Real-world examples of agents losing focus due to keyword mentions

## Task Complexity Assessment
This is a **complex task** requiring in-depth research, analysis of academic literature, industry reports, and real-world examples.

## Research Methodology
- **Task Type**: Search-Focused with Verification Components
- **Sources Priority**: Academic papers, industry reports, technical documentation, case studies
