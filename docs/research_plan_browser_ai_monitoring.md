# Browser-Based AI Agent Monitoring Research Plan

## Objective
Research how browser-based AI agents work and identify integration points for monitoring, focusing on five key areas:
1. AI chat interfaces functionality (DOM structure, event handling, message flow)
2. Methods for injecting monitoring code into web pages  
3. Browser extension capabilities for real-time monitoring
4. Security considerations for cross-origin communication
5. Technical approaches used by existing AI monitoring tools

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Baseline Research and Understanding
