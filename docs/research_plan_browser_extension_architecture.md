# Browser Extension Architecture Design Plan

## Task Overview
Design a comprehensive technical architecture for a browser extension that can supervise AI agents, covering all specified components.

## Required Components to Design
1. [x] Extension manifest requirements and permissions
2. [x] Content script injection strategies
3. [x] Background service worker architecture
4. [x] Communication patterns between extension components
5. [x] Data capture and processing pipelines
6. [x] Integration with external supervisor servers

## Research and Design Steps

### Phase 1: Architecture Foundation
- [x] Research current browser extension standards (Manifest V3)
- [x] Analyze AI agent supervision requirements
- [x] Define system architecture overview
- [x] Identify security and privacy considerations

### Phase 2: Component Design
- [x] Design manifest structure with appropriate permissions
- [x] Plan content script injection and isolation strategies
- [x] Architect background service worker functionality
- [x] Design inter-component communication protocols
- [x] Plan data capture mechanisms and processing pipelines
- [x] Design external server integration patterns

### Phase 3: Technical Specifications
- [x] Define API contracts and data schemas
- [x] Plan error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [x] Design performance optimization strategies
- [x] Address cross-browser compatibility

### Phase 4: Documentation and Delivery
- [x] Compile comprehensive architecture document
- [x] Include code examples and implementation guidance
- [x] Provide deployment and configuration instructions
- [x] Save final document to 'docs/browser_extension_architecture.md'

## Success Criteria
- All 6 required components fully addressed
- Technical feasibility verified
- Security considerations included
- Implementation guidance provided
- Clean, professional documentation
