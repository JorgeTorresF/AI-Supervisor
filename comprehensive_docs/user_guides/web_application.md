## Core Features

### Idea Validation

1. **Access**: Click "Idea Validator" in the navigation menu
2. **Input**: Enter your project idea in the text area
3. **Analyze**: Click "Validate Idea" button
4. **Review**: Examine the feasibility score, warnings, and suggestions

#### Example Validation
```
Idea: "Build a social media app like Facebook"

Result:
‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Level: HIGH
üìä Feasibility Score: 4/10

‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings:

- Requires significant resources and funding
- Legal and privacy compliance challenges

üí° Suggestions:
- Consider targeting a specific niche market
- Focus on unique features competitors lack
- Start with MVP and iterate based on feedback
```

### Task Monitoring

1. **Start Monitoring**: Begin an AI agent session
2. **Set Context**: Define your current task or project
3. **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor agent responses for coherence
4. **Intervention Alerts**: Receive notifications when issues are detected

#### Task Context Setup
```json
{
  "task_title": "Develop a mobile app backend",
  "task_description": "Create REST API for a fitness tracking app",
  "expected_deliverables": [
    "API endpoints documentation",
    "Database schema",
    "Authentication system"
  ],
  "time_limit": "4 hours"
}
```

### Intervention Center

View and manage all intervention events:

#### Intervention Types
- **Warning**: Low-priority alerts about potential issues
- **Redirect**: Suggestions to refocus on the main task
- **Block**: High-priority alerts about serious problems
- **Suggest**: Recommendations for improvement

#### Sample Intervention
```
üéØ TASK FOCUS ALERT
Time: 2:34 PM
Type: Redirect
Confidence: 85%

The agent seems to be deviating from the main task.

Current Task: Develop REST API endpoints
Detected Issue: Off-topic discussion about UI design

Suggested Action: 
"Please focus on the backend API development as specified. 
UI design can be addressed in a separate task."
```

## Advanced Features

### Real-time Collaboration

When multiple deployment modes are connected:

1. **Sync Status**: Green indicator shows active connections
2. **Cross-platform Updates**: Changes sync across all modes
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle configuration conflicts
4. **Activity Sharing**: View activities from other deployment modes

### Analytics Dashboard

Track your supervision effectiveness:

#### Key Metrics
- **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of successfully completed tasks
- **Intervention Effectiveness**: How often interventions prevent derailment
- **Idea Validation Usage**: Number of ideas validated and outcomes
- **Response Time**: Average time to detect and respond to issues
